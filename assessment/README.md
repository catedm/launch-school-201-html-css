- I could not find any way to style the first option on the select boxes in the modal to be a grayed out color.

- I checked the site in chrome, firefox and safari.

- I got an error in the HTML W3C validator for using 2 "/" inside of my definition list to separate the day, month and year select inputs. I ignored this error - it did not seem like a big deal to me. I'm sure you will correct me if I am wrong here.

- I realize there is both a 'main' tag and a #main id, which seems confusing. But the instructions indicated using a #main id and I also needed to use the 'main' tag for styling purposes (specifically for the margins in order to collapse the mobile menu).
